# Agent commentary (invocation 15)

The mobile enemy reached `(40,41)` and immediately reversed its pip to Up in the same settled frame. It therefore ignores side branches and bounces along the fixed vertical five-node track rather than turning into the loop.

Using this confirmed patrol cycle, I ran a dynamic BFS over player position, patrol phase, and the static enemy’s alive bit. The shortest safe route from the current state is 14 moves. It uses the right loop to pass the mobile enemy, captures the static enemy from its safe right side, and then reaches the goal.
