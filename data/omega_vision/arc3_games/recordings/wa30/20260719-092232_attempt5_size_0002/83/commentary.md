# Agent commentary (invocation 37)

The diff shows both entities moved: the player/cargo moved up as predicted, while the helper moved right from `(14,11)` to `(15,11)`. Thus the helper resolves equal-distance cargo approaches horizontally first and will grab `(15,13)` from above, carrying it with a vertical offset toward `(3,6)`. The player’s route to `(2,7)` remains collision-free.

## Predicted cells (x, y, old, new)

[[49, 41, 14], [53, 41, 9], [52, 40, 0], [61, 49, 12]]
