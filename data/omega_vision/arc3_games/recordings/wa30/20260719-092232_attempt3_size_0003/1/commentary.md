# Agent commentary (invocation 16)

The failed move was caused by a simultaneous head-on conflict:

- Before step 64, the player occupied `(9,9)` and tried to enter `(8,9)`.
- The helper occupied `(8,9)` and intended to enter `(9,9)`.
- The player stayed in place while the helper rerouted down to `(8,10)`.
- The deadline still advanced.

The route is now clear. Seven left moves place the held cargo in bottom-left temporarily, then one up move inserts it into middle-left `(3,8)` for release. Meanwhile, the helper should reach and collect the final cargo.
